- (DONE) dash
- (done) double jump
- (done) air dash
- serialize move dir
- refactor run + jump => movementFSM
- knockback on attacks
- damage / health system
- limit lock / unlock events to a single unit (rather than all players)
- use trigger rather than collision to detect grounded state
- add buffered inputs to grounded landing

move set:
- aerials:
- - 2 hit air sword chain
- - - hit one, knock forward
- - - hit two, knock up
- - down attack:
- - - kicks: bounce enemy down
- - forward attack:
- - - down air slash: bounce enemy forward
- ground:
- - 3 hit punch combo
- - up attack: first standing sword animation
- - right attack: bounce enemy, last sword animation
- - right attack running: dash punch


- player vertical movement
- - if player connects with aerial attack
- - - remove negative y velocity
- - if player misses with aerial attack
- - - keep current velocity

- detecting player input:
- - forward + attack triggers forwardAttack
- - forward => wait => attack does not trigger forwardAttack
- - forward => backward + attack triggers backwardAttack


- horizontal knockback has to factor in player direction
